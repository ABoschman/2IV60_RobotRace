The final submission was marked 10/10. \r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\nA full description of the requirements can be found here. For course information, check the [course website](https://www.win.tue.nl/~vanwijk/2IV60/) at win.tue.nl.\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\nIn short, the assignment was to use OpenGL in Java to create a simple 3D environment in which four robots would run around on spline-shaped tracks. For bonus exercises we also implemented smooth camera transitions, procedurally generated trees and realistic fractal-shaped terrain, generated with the Square-Diamond algorithm. As an additional challenge, we used retained mode with VBO's, rather than the deprecated immediate mode which was suggested.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
