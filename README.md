## Background
This project was made by Arjan Boschman and RÃ¶bke Geenen as part of an assignment for the TU/e pre-master course Computer Graphics (Course code 2IV60). The final submission was marked 10/10. 

## Requirements

## Overview
In short, the assignment was to use OpenGL in Java to create a simple 3D environment in which four robots would run around on spline-shaped tracks. For bonus exercises we also implemented smooth camera transitions, procedurally generated trees and realistic fractal-shaped terrain, generated with the Square-Diamond algorithm. As an additional challenge, we used retained mode with VBO's, rather than the deprecated immediate mode which was suggested.
